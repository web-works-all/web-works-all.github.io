<h1>Adventure Tourism</h1>
<p> Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.</p>

<h1>Some Unique Festivals & Events in India </h1>
<h2>Aoling Festival of the Konyak Headhunters</h2>
<img src="img/Aoling-Festival.jpg">
<p>
<b>Where:</b> Mon district, Nagaland<br><br>
<b>When:</b> April<br>
<br>
While the more famous Hornbill Festival sees a larger confluence of Nagaland’s many flamboyant tribes, it’s a show mainly for the benefit of tourists. The Aoling tribal festival is more authentic, and gives you a true taste of Konyak, an erstwhile headhunter clan. This is their celebration welcoming Spring, and offering prayers for a good harvest. This is a fantastic opportunity to spend time with the otherwise hard-to-engage with Konyaks; already a diminishing tribe. They have elaborate tattoos inked on their bodies and faces in particular.  
<br><br>
While you are there: Visit Longwa, a unique village on the Indo-Burma border where half the houses are Indian and the other half, Burmese. The village chief’s house is particularly delightful, given that the international border runs right down the middle.
</p>


<h2>The Mask Dances of Hemis</h2>
<img src="img/maskdance.jpg">
<p>
<b>Where:</b> Hemis, Ladakh<br><br>
<b>When:</b> June – July
<br><br>
Sandwiched between gigantic cliffs skirting the edge of Hemis National Park in Ladakh, the 17th century Hemis monastery, is at once magical and imposing beneath the jagged peaks. Each year the charm grows manifold when it plays host to one of the biggest and most popular festivals of Ladakh – the Hemis Festival. Celebrated in honor of Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava (one of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism), the traditional music and the mask dances, or Chams, performed in the monastery courtyard are a spectacle. Complete with sound and visual effects, from the large drums and the long copper trumpets. Do keep in mind that the festival is naturally very popular, so be prepared to be pushed and shoved.
<br><br>
While you are there: Also make time for spotting the ancient rock paintings, petroglyphs created 2000 to 4000 years ago in the nearby Dah Hanu and Batalik region. Few paintings are carefully preserved in the Domkhar Rock Art Sanctuary even as many are vandalized due to ignorance.
<br><br>
If you’re there for a week or more, you can hike on the popular Markha Valley and camp at friendly villages in homestays along the trail.
</p>

<h2>Nehru Boat Race</h2>
<img src="img/Nehru-Boat-Race.jpg">
<p>
<b>Where:</b> Allapuzha, Kerala<br><br>
<b>When:</b> August<br><br>

One of the most popular boat races in Kerala, Nehru Boat Race, on the serene waters of  Punnamada Lake,  draws huge crowds from across the country. Witness hundreds of men working in clockwork-like unison to paddle 100-feet long canoes – Chundan Vallam (most of us know them as snake boats) – along a 1.4 kilometer long course. Several Vallam Kali (boat games) events happen across the state during autumn as part of the harvest festival. The Nehru Boat Race has carved a space for itself since its inception in 1952 when it started as a welcoming event for Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, and later morphed into a race.
<br><br>
<b>While you are there:</b> Steal a quick trip to the palm fringed backwaters of Kuttanad that’s not only famous for its verdant rice fields but also for being 2.2 meters below sea level, a geological peculiarity
</p>

<h2>Losar in Ladakh</h2>
<img src="img/losar.jpg">

<p>
<b>Where:</b> Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir<br><br>
<b>When:</b> February<br><br>

In the stark winters of Ladakh when an eerie silence falls upon the roof of the world, the Cham songs and dances of Losar add a new spunk of colour to the barren landscape. Witnessing the mask dances in the backdrop of snow-covered mountains in bone-chilling cold might not be everyone’s cup of tea but the Tibetan new year celebrations in Ladakh’s gompas (monasteries) offer the intrepid explorers a rare glimpse into the ancient rituals and traditions unfettered by the ills of mass commercialization.
<br><br>
<b>While you are there:</b> Try walking on the famous Chadar that will soon become stuff of past either due to climate change or completion of the road to Zanskar.
